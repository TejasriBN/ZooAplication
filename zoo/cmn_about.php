		<h2><u> About us </u></h2>
	</center>
	
		Welcome to the official Zoo database! Here, we care for all sorts of animals and birds, including Alligators, Echidnae, and even Boa-Constrictors. They are cared for by our dedicated team 
		of zoo keepers and veterinarians. We would like to inform our valuable customers that we strictly adhere to the Wildlife Protection Act, and keep maintain the importance of animal rights and
		comfort above all else. We are proud to announce our distinguished awards for our service, in regards to the protection and safe-keeping of the animals kept within this zoo.
		Customers are welcome to visit the hospitality centre, where they may book tours around our 1500 acres of protected zoo land. There, you may also find the gift-shop to buy souvenirs from.
		<br><br>
		Our department of botany is renowned world-over, as the largest and most effective group of botanists. They include Floriculturists, Conservation Biologists, and Horticulturists. We encourage
		you to visit the Botany Building, to peruse their wonderful achievements. There, you will also find a garden, filled to the brim with an assortment of various orchids, Campions, and a rare
		Kadupul flower, amongst many other beautiful plants.
		<br><br>
		In addition to this, we also have a team of scientists who conduct research on the animals. This has, indeed, lead to numerous technical advancements. Their facilities are, however, strictly
		off-limits to the public. For those interested, we have a collection of detailed videos on the kind of research conducted, as well as an archive of monthly logs, dating back to the founding date
		of the research department in July 1998.
		<br><br>
		Finally, we would like to thank our finance department, without whom our operation would collapse. We are funded primarily by the donations of our most honourable patrons, and partially funded
		by the Government as well. Our finance department accounts for all the money flowing in and out. Detailed reports are generated and published on a quarterly basis.
